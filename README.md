# Garage Security System with LilyGo TTGO SIM800L

The ideia of this project came from a person who, guess what, was interested on a security system for his garage with a ESP32, but had little knowledge programming. Working on a electronic store, found it easy to build one with a couple of components laying around the office.

**WHAT IS LILYGO TTGO SIM800L?**

TLDR: It's an ESP32 with a SIM800L built-in. Was originally designed to work almost as a cellphone (has mic and spk outputs).
